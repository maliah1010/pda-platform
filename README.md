PDA Platform gives Claude and other MCP-compatible AI assistants the tools to perform rigorous, evidence-based project delivery assurance aligned to IPA Gate Reviews (Gates 0–5), HM Treasury Green Book appraisal, and GMPP reporting standards. It is the only open-source MCP platform specifically designed for Senior Responsible Owners, Project Managers, Independent Assurance Reviewers, and Portfolio Managers working in UK government major project delivery.

Connect Claude to the platform and ask it to conduct a full gate readiness assessment, generate a Delivery Confidence Assessment, run an Earned Value analysis, detect stale risk registers, benchmark cost estimates against IPA historical data, or produce board-ready health summaries — all grounded in real project data, IPA methodology, and pre-loaded government benchmark statistics.

**Live demo:** `https://pda-platform-i33p.onrender.com/sse` — connect any MCP client in under 60 seconds, no installation required.

## Who is this for?

| Role | What the platform does for you |
|------|-------------------------------|
| **Senior Responsible Owner** | Board-ready health summaries, delivery confidence assessments, benefits realisation status, gate readiness position — in plain English, grounded in data |
| **Project Manager** | Schedule health, critical path analysis, Earned Value (SPI/CPI/EAC), risk velocity tracking, resource conflict detection, change pressure analysis |
| **Independent Assurance Reviewer** | Full IPA Gate Review workflow (13 steps), confidence divergence detection, ARMM maturity assessment, pre-mortem question generation, reference class benchmarking |
| **Portfolio Manager** | Cross-project health rollup, aggregate benefit confidence, systemic risk detection, portfolio coherence scoring, intervention prioritisation |

---

## Connect in 60 seconds

**No installation — remote connection:**

Connect any MCP-compatible client directly to the hosted endpoint:
```
https://pda-platform-i33p.onrender.com/sse
```

**Claude Desktop — local install:**
```bash
pip install pda-platform
```

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pda-platform": {
      "command": "pda-platform-server",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

## What Claude can do with 103 tools

Once connected, Claude can answer questions like:

- *"Run a full IPA Gate 3 readiness assessment for Project Alpha and produce a Delivery Confidence Assessment."*
- *"Our cost estimate is £42m. Is that realistic for an IT programme of this scale compared to similar government projects?"*
- *"Which risks on Project Beta are accelerating? Has the risk register been actively maintained?"*
- *"Produce a board-ready summary of portfolio health for the investment committee."*
- *"Generate pre-mortem challenge questions for the Gate 3 review panel."*
- *"Run an Earned Value analysis and tell me if this project's cost trajectory is sustainable."*
- *"Which of my six projects needs the most urgent assurance intervention this quarter?"*

---

## Key Features

- **IPA Gate Review alignment** — Gates 0–5 and PAR, 8-dimension DCA scoring with gate-specific weighting, conditions vs recommendations distinction
- **HMT Green Book compliance** — benefits management, optimism bias detection, reference class forecasting against IPA historical benchmarks
- **GMPP-ready reporting** — RAG ratings, NISTA compliance tracking, quarterly data returns
- **Production-grade risk intelligence** — risk velocity tracking, stale register detection, quantified risk exposure
- **Earned Value Management** — SPI, CPI, EAC, TCPI, VAC with HTML dashboard generation
- **Benefits Realisation Management** — P3M3-aligned maturity scoring, dependency network, drift detection, Green Book narrative generation
- **Portfolio intelligence** — cross-project health rollup, aggregate DCA distribution, systemic risk detection
- **Pre-loaded IPA knowledge base** — benchmark statistics from IPA Annual Reports 2019–2024, 8 evidence-based failure patterns, guidance references (Green Book, Cabinet Office Controls, GovS002)
- **Pre-mortem question generation** — structured challenge questions for Gates 0–5, targeting optimism bias, groupthink, and known cognitive failure modes
- **ARMM maturity assessment** — 251-criterion AI readiness assessment across 4 dimensions and 28 topics
- **8 schedule data format parsers** — MSPDI, Primavera P6, Jira, Monday, Asana, Smartsheet, GMPP, NISTA
- **Cross-module red flag scanner** — single tool (`scan_for_red_flags`) queries risk, benefits, gate conditions, cost, change, and resources simultaneously and returns a prioritised CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM alert list
- **Narrative divergence detection** — `detect_narrative_divergence` compares written project narrative against quantitative data, classifying claims as SUPPORTED/CONTRADICTED/UNVERIFIABLE; directly targets optimism bias
- **Monte Carlo schedule simulation** — probabilistic P50/P80/P90 delivery dates using PERT distributions, optionally calibrated against the risk register
- **AI-powered narrative generation** — multi-sample consensus with confidence scoring, IPA-format executive summaries
- **Agent Readiness Maturity Model** — governance framework for AI deployment on major projects
